  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.github.io/">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers with high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. Data Carpentry's focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. This event is an example-driven two-day workshop on basic data science computing skills. Short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and participants are encouraged both to help one another, and to try applying what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions. Participants should bring their own laptops to work on and have permissions to install programs on them. The initial target audience of this workshop is learners who have little to no prior computational experience. It will be a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery.

The <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/is/data-management">Research Data Service</a> is a suite of tools and support for University staff and students to aid them in data management planning, working with data, sharing and preserving their data, and re-skilling. It is delivered by a virtual team spanning across a number of sections of Information Services including EDINA and Data Library, Library & University Collections, IT Infrastructure, User Services, and the Digital Curation Centre.</a>

  The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustanability Institute</a>'s mission is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (<a href="http://softwaresaved.spreadshirt.co.uk/"><em>better software, better research</em></a>). Software is fundamental to research: <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers">seven out of ten UK researchers report that their work would be impossible without it</a>.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop,
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop. If you run into any problems,
please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on
the first day.

Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.

<p>This workshop will be using the software outlined in the install instructions below.
Please see the section for your operating system for those directions.
<ul>
<li><a href=#windows>Windows</a>
<li><a href=#mac>Mac</a>
<li><a href=#linux>Linux</a>
</ul>
